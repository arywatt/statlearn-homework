# Part I -  Song genre classification 


## Installing and importing libraries

```{r}

# this part is to be executed only once to install libraries we need 
# i kindly suggest you run this on windows OS
# But if you feel like  solving R dependencies hell on linux... give it a try .
# about macOS , don't really know
# 
# 
# install.packages('signal')
# install.packages('audio')
# install.packages('wrassp')
# install.packages('warbleR')
# install.packages('tuneR')
# install.packages('audiolyzR')




```


```{r ,include=FALSE}
# then we import all libraries needed here
suppressMessages(require(signal, quietly = T))
library(signal)

suppressMessages(require(audio, quietly = T)) 
library(audio)

suppressMessages(require(wrassp,  quietly = T))
library(wrassp)

library(soundgen)
library(warbleR)
library(tuneR)
library(audiolyzR)


```

## Reading and describing Data
```{r}
# My path to the data 
auPath <- "hw_data"
labelsFile <- paste0(auPath,'/labels.txt')
labelsFile

# List the .au files
auFiles <- list.files(auPath, pattern=glob2rx('*.au'), full.names=TRUE)


# Number of files 
N <- length(auFiles)

```

we have a total of {N} songs in our dataset .


```{r}
## Let's try to get the files in order 
ord = c(1:N)
ordFileList = paste0(rep(paste0(auPath,'/f')),paste0(ord,rep('.au',N)))
#ordFileList

# let's get also labels for each files
labels <- read.table(file=labelsFile, header=TRUE, sep=" ",col.names  = c('genre'))
 
labels = labels['genre']
dim(labels)
str(labels)
barplot(table(labels$genre))


```

```{r}

# Load an audio file, e.g. the first one in the list above
x <- read.AsspDataObj(ordFileList[1])
str(attributes(x))
 
#Then we set a fixed samples length for all files
# as the minimum lenght of all of them 
fixedLength = 22050 * 30 # default length


for (i in 1:N) {
  x <- read.AsspDataObj(auFiles[i])
  min = attributes(x)$endRecord   # the samples length of the current file
  fixedLength <- ifelse(fixedLength<=min, fixedLength, min) # we take the minimum
}

fixedLength
```

We can see from the output that The records were made at a sample rate of 22050hz 
for a duration of 30 seconds and therefore  contains around 22050 * 30 = 661500 samples

Now lets' plot the first file samples to get a general idea


```{r}

# We 
# (only plot every 10th element to accelerate plotting)

x = read.AsspDataObj(ordFileList[1])
x

ith = 22050 /5 # ith element to plot . basically we are plotting elements each 0.2s

x_axe = seq(0,numRecs.AsspDataObj(x) - 1, ith) / rate.AsspDataObj(x)

y_axe =  x$audio[c(TRUE, rep(FALSE,ith-1))]

plot(x_axe,
     y_axe,
     type='l',
     xlab='time (s)',
     ylab='Audio samples')

```

## Features Extractions 

### Features to extract

#### Zero crossing rate 

The zero-crossing rate is the rate of sign-changes along a signal, i.e., the rate at which the signal changes from positive to zero to negative or from negative to zero to positive.[1] This feature has been used heavily in both speech recognition and music information retrieval, being a key feature to classify percussive sounds.


####  Spectral Centroid and others statistics 

the spectral prperties are a set of statistics computed on the spectrum of an audio signal, sucha as 
- Spectral Centroid ( most important one)
- Spectral mean or median 
- spectral quartiles , skewness and kurtosis

The spectral centroid is a measure used in digital signal processing to characterise a spectrum. It indicates where the center of mass of the spectrum is located. Perceptually, it has a robust connection with the impression of brightness of a sound.
We basically loop on on audio files, and compute some features using functions defined above .

It is calculated as the weighted mean of the frequencies present in the signal, determined using a Fourier transform, with their magnitudes as the weights



#### Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
 Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for an object of class Wave. In speech recognition MFCCs are used to extract the stimulus of the vocal tract from speech
 
 

####  Pitch and loudness 

Pitch is a perceptual property of sounds that allows their ordering on a frequency-related scale, or more commonly, pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as "higher" and "lower" in the sense associated with musical melodies. Pitch can be determined only in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. Pitch is a major auditory attribute of musical tones, along with duration, loudness, and timbre.


With the soundgen library we can analyse the sound to retrieve some feature lke ,
the average pitch, the loudness,the peak frequncies, whether sound contains voice or not , the harmonics. All thoses values will hell differentiate genre of music.
Below an Exemple of  plot showing a classic music, a country music

### Implementation with R

In R we used principally package 
 - Seawave
 - SoundGen
 - TuneR
 
#### Convert audio data to wave 

```{r}

# Transform


# x : array to transform 
# rate : the sample rate of x 
# bit : 
# reduceRate : wether reduce the sample rate or not 
# newRate  # if down Sample is TRUE, new sample rate to use 
transformToWave <- function(x, rate, bit = 16,reduceRate = FALSE, newRate = 11025 ){
  xwv = Wave( as.numeric(x), samp.rate = rate, bit = bit)
  if(reduceRate){
    xwv = downsample(xwv, samp.rate = newRate)
    xwv = xwv@left
  }
  #transformedWave <- ifelse(reduceRate,  downsample(xwv, samp.rate = newRate),xwv)
  return( xwv)

```

We save the dataset  to a file

```{r}
 data = data.frame(labels,data)
 write.csv(data,file = 'dataset.csv')

```

```{r}
data = read.csv('dataset.csv',header = TRUE,sep = ',')[-1]
str(data)
which(is.na(data))

```


### Data preparation 

```{r}

# we standadize the data
data.scaled = cbind(labels,scale(data[-1]))
#data_scaled = data


# Train-Test split
library(caret)
set.seed(13413) # set seed for reproducibility
idx.tr = createDataPartition(y = data$genre, p = .65, list = FALSE)
head(idx.tr)

data.tr = data.scaled[ idx.tr, ]
data.te = data.scaled[-idx.tr, ]

# Take a look (nicely balanced)
table(data.scaled$genre)




```




### Classification
#### RandomForest

We Build the model 
```{r}

library(randomForest)
rf = randomForest(genre ~ .,
                  data = data.tr,
                  na.action = na.omit,
                  importance = FALSE,
                  ntree = 1000
                  )

# Take a look
rf

```

Test the model 

```{r}

pred = predict(rf, data.te)
confusionMatrix(data.te$genre, pred)

```

Let's see variables importance 
```{r}

rf.imp = importance(rf)
rf.imp = rf.imp[  order(rf.imp, decreasing = T),   ]
rf.imp


# Plot
jnk = barplot( rf.imp, xaxt = "n" )
text(x = jnk - .25, y = -.4, names(rf.imp), 
     xpd = TRUE, srt = 45, cex = .5)

```
```{r}

varImpPlot(rf, main = "Random Forest")

```


let's tune the model 

```{r}

library(randomForest)
library(mlbench)
library(caret)
library(e1071)
 



#10 folds repeat 3 times
control <- trainControl(method='repeatedcv', 
                        number=10, 
                        repeats=3
                       )
#Metric compare model is Accuracy
metric <- "Accuracy"


rf.tune <- train(genre~., 
                      data=data.tr, 
                      method='rf', 
                      metric=c('recall','accuracy'), 
                      tuneLength = 15
                      )


### here we take the best model 
rf.best = rf.tune$finalModel

print(rf.tune)


plot(rf.tune)



 
```
 
```{r}
pred.best = predict(rf.best, data.te)

confusionMatrix(data.te$genre, pred.best )


```



```{r}


rf.imp = importance(rf.best)
rf.imp = rf.imp[  order(rf.imp, decreasing = T),   ]
rf.imp

# Plot
jnk = barplot( rf.imp, xaxt = "n" )
text(x = jnk - .25, y = -.4, names(rf.imp), 
     xpd = TRUE, srt = 45, cex = .5)

```



## MAp
### Principal component

We retrieve the Principal comonents
```{r}

data.scaled.num = data.scaled[-1]

     if(j==1) features_names = append(features_names, 'energyBandSum'
                                      #paste0('energy_band_',1:8)
                                     )
    #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


  featurelist[j] = c(list(features))
   
  
}
```
We create a dataframe with features extracted 


```{r}
newdata = as.data.frame(matrix(unlist(featurelist),   
                            nrow=length(unlist(featurelist[2]))
                            )
                     )
#
features_names = c(features_names)
row.names(data1) = features_names
newdata= t(newdata)[-1] # we remove the row names

```



We predict genre
```{r}

# pred.new is the pdictions arrays for all files to predict 
# rf.best is our best model 
pred.new = predict(rf.best, newdata)


#to test the accurary
genre = NULL    # this is the vectore of true gtype of music , to be initialized

confusionMatrix(genre, pred.new ) # genre is the target column


```



# Part II -  Theory

```{r}





```
